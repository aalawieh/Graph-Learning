# Network Analysis and Graph Learning Homework

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the Network Science and Graph Learning homework, focusing on analyzing social network structures using the **Facebook100** dataset. The implementation involves multiple network science algorithms to derive insights from real-world data.

## Homework Questions and Solutions
- **Question 2:** Analyzing degree distribution, clustering coefficients, and edge density.
- **Question 3:** Examining assortativity in relation to student/faculty status, major, dorm, and gender.
- **Question 4:** Implementing link prediction algorithms (Common Neighbors, Jaccard, Adamic/Adar) and evaluating their effectiveness.
- **Question 5:** Implementing label propagation for recovering missing attributes (dorm, major, gender) and assessing accuracy.
- **Question 6:** Conducting community detection to analyze group formation within selected universities.

## Dataset
The **Facebook100** dataset is used throughout this analysis. It can be accessed at:
